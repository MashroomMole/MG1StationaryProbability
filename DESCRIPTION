Description: The idea of a computational algorithm described in the article (Springer)<https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-92507-9_13>
    The purpose of this package is to automate computations for M/G/1 with alternating Poisson flow of arrivals. It offers a set of functions to calculate various mean indices of the system, including mean flow intensity, mean service busy and idle times, and the system's stationary probability.
